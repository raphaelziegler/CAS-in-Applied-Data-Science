The linear regression does not seem to achieve the desired accuracy at the moment; further refinements are to be made. The range of values of the input variables could be further restricted, which means a limitation in the application (not all ranges can be covered). This would be a feasible way and is an acceptable limitation of use.\\
Certain input data splits have a small number of columns (e.g. steel/concrete compound columns, 135 pieces), making prediction difficult/impossible.\\

\noindent
The results of the neural network are still pending.
