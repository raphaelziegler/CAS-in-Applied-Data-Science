The prediction accuracy should not fall below 70\%. Otherwise, the construction costs for the offer would fluctuate too much.
The share of column costs in an average building project is about 5\% of the construction costs. With a prediction accuracy of 70\%, there is a cost uncertainty of 1.5\% on the total price.\\
It should be noted that due to the use of purchase prices, we are always slightly behind the market, and the most current market conditions are not included in the table.\\

\noindent
The following procedure is planned to reach the desired accuracy:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item clean up the data (remove obvious input errors)
    \item model test with all data
    \item split data into column types
    \item split data into column types and cross-section shapes
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
If the desired accuracy cannot be achieved, it must be decided on a case-by-case basis whether the prediction accuracy is acceptable for the current construction project. 
\begin{description}
    \item[Example:] If the accuracy of the prediction is 60\% and we require accuracy in the final price of 1.5\%, the share of the columns in the final price must not exceed 3.75\%.
\end{description}
